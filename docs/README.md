## Overview

### Intro
This is a React/Redux Single Page Application. The app is to show the local weather condition of input city on the map. I used Echartjs to do the data visualization. [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/current) offer various free APIs for weather conditions.


### Quickstart

1.  First, clone the app to local and start app

    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/zhenyu0519/weather_app.git
    ```
    ```Shell
    npm run start
    ```

2.  Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

### Development

Run `npm start` to see your app at `localhost:3000`

### Building & Deploying

Run `npm run build`, which will compile all the necessary files to the
`build` folder.


### Structure

The [`app/`](../../../tree/master/app) directory contains your entire application code, including CSS,
JavaScript, HTML and tests.

The rest of the folders and files only exist to make your life easier, and
should not need to be touched.
