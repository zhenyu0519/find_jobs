### Intro
This is a React/Redux Single Page Application. The app is to show the local weather condition of input city on the map. I used Echartjs to do the data visualization. [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/current) offer various free APIs for weather conditions.


### Quickstart

1.  First, clone the app to local and start app

    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/zhenyu0519/weather_app.git
    ```
    ```Shell
    npm install
    ```
    ```Shell
    npm run start
    ```

2.  Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

### Development

Run `npm start` to see your app at `localhost:3000`

### Building & Deploying

Run `npm run build`, which will compile all the necessary files to the
`build` folder.


### Structure

The [`app/`](../../../tree/master/app) directory contains your entire application code, including CSS,
JavaScript and HTML.
